# GitHub key pair has been generated with following command:

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/github.key -C "piotr1morawiec@gmail.com"

# Flags:
#   -t ed25519                    : Specifies the type of key to create.
#                                   The possible values are “rsa1” for protocol version 1 and
#                                   “dsa”, “ecdsa”, “ed25519”, or “rsa” for protocol version 2.
#   -b 4096                       : Specifies the number of bits in the key to create
#   -f ~/.ssh/github.key          : Specifies the filename of the key file.
#   -C "piotr1morawiec@gmail.com" : Set a new comment related to a keypair


# Unfortunately, the key generated with above mthod didn't work, so the standard RSA key has been generated:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096

# This one works correctly
